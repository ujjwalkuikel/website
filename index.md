<p class="Stakeholders"><span class="spcolor">Introduction</span> <br>There's a new OnePlus phone coming. Yes, yet another OnePlus. Except, it's not actually coming. You'll never be able to buy it, but you might see some of its innovations and design features in a real product in the future. It's called the OnePlus Concept One and was unveiled at CES 2020, and is yet another example of the way partnering with McLaren has worked out well for OnePlus. </p>

<span class="pcolor">Specification</span> 
<hr> 
<p> This is essentially the OnePlus 7T Pro in new skin, the specifications are the same. That means a Snapdragon 855+ processor, 12GB RAM and a 4,085mAh battery with 30W fast-charging. 

Just like it did with the OnePlus 7 Pro, 7T and 7T Pro, OnePlus has used a 90Hz refresh rate panel for the display, enabling smooth animation and gesture response. 

As you'd suspect, the screen is the same resolution and size as the 7T Pro. Specifically, that means a 6.67-inch panel with curved edges and quad HD resolution (1440 x 3120). 

Likewise, the triple camera on the back features the same specs as the 7T Pro. That means a 48-megapixel main sensor with OIS, plus the 3x Zoom 8-megapixel camera and a 16-megapixel ultra-wide camera.

<p class="pcolor"> Description<br> 
<span class="nocolor">The Concept One is exactly that—a concept—and OnePlus says it has no plans to ship it anytime soon. But according to Pete Lau, the OnePlus cofounder and chief executive who spoke with WIRED via video chat, the phone represents a “bold exploration for OnePlus and is also a representation of overcoming a lot of [engineering] challenges.”</span></p>
